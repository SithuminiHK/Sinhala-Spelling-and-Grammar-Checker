# Sinhala-Spelling-and-Grammar-Checker
Sinhala spelling and grammar checker tool by 2020/E/065 and 2020/E/085

This project is an advanced Sinhala Spelling and Grammar Checker designed to identify and correct spelling and grammatical errors in Sinhala text. It integrates a hybrid approach combining rule-based correction and AI-powered grammar enhancement using Google Gemini's API, providing high accuracy and flexibility

## **Features**
Rule-Based Grammar Correction:  
-Utilizes predefined grammar rules to correct common Sinhala grammatical mistakes.  
-Efficient for specific, repeatable grammar patterns.  
AI-Powered Enhancement:  
    -Leverages the Google Gemini API for dynamic grammar correction and restructuring.  
    -Supports advanced grammar correction beyond predefined rules, ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness.  
Customizable Grammar Rules:  
    -Supports loading user-defined rules from an external file for rule-based corrections.  
Dynamic Token Management:  
    -Optimizes output based on the number of tokens in the input text for efficient AI responses.  

## **How It Works**
Rule-Based Correction:
    -Loads a set of grammar rules from a file.
    -Applies these rules to detect and correct common errors in the input Sinhala text.
AI Integration:
-Processes the rule-corrected text through the Google Gemini API.
-Ensures grammatical accuracy and adherence to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order in Sinhala.
Hybrid Approach:
-Combines the strengths of both rule-based and AI-powered methods to deliver robust corrections.
